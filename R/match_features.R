#' Extract feature intensity values from unidentified feature data
#'
#' Matches unidentified feature intensities with identified feature clusters.
#' The mass and retention time of each unidentified feature is compared to the
#' centroid of each identified cluster. If the unidentified feature falls within
#' the specified mass and retention time threshold it is added to the cluster.
#'
#' @param ms2 A \code{data.table} containing the identified feature data.
#'
#' @param ms1 A \code{data.table} containing the unidentified feature data.
#'   This data is created from the files output by TopPIC ending with
#'   "ms1.feature" and must contain the \code{RTalign} and \code{RecalMass}
#'   variables. These variables are created with the unidentified feature data
#'   in the \code{align_rt} and \code{recalibrate_mass} functions.
#'
#' @param errors A \code{list} output from the \code{calc_error} function. The
#'   first element of the list contains the standard deviation and median of the
#'   mass measurement error for each data set. The second element is the
#'   standard deviation of the mass measurement error across all data sets. The
#'   third element is the standard deviation of the retention time in seconds
#'   across all data sets.
#'
#' @param n_mme_sd A numeric value indicating the number of standard
#'   deviations to use when creating a cutoff in the mass dimension. This
#'   threshold is used for determining whether an unidentified feature is close
#'   enough in mass to be considered part of an identified feature cluster. The
#'   mean \code{RecalMass} of all points in the cluster is used for the
#'   comparison.
#'
#' @param n_rt_sd A numeric value representing the number of standard deviations
#'   to use when creating a retention time cutoff. This value is the threshold
#'   used to determine if an unidentified feature is close enough in retention
#'   time to be considered part of an identified feature cluster. The mean
#'   retention time of all points in the cluster is used for the comparison.
#'
#' @param summary_fn A character string specifying the function to use when
#'   summarizing the feature intensity. The function must contain the
#'   \code{na.rm} argument. Some examples of functions that are allowed are
#'   \code{max}, \code{sum}, or \code{median}.
#'
#' @param cores \code{integer} Number of cores for parallelization.
#'   Default is NULL. If NULL then the maximum number of cores is used,
#'   but no more than R's limit of 125.
#'
#' @return A \code{data.table} containing all unidentified features that fall
#'   within the threshold of an identified feature gene/cluster combination.
