# The main function will create a new column pcg for Proteoform Cluster Group
# (similar to cluster_new from the merge_clusters function). This function will
# start with the most abundant cluster's centroid and compare all remaining
# cluster centroids to it and group them if the centroids fall within the
# mass/rt envelope of the main cluster. If clusters are grouped with the main
# cluster their centroids will be removed from the list and will not be
# considered in creating their own group with other clusters.

#' Combines clusters based on mass and retention time
#'
#' Compares the centroid of each cluster within a gene and combines the two
#' clusters if the centroids fall within the specified threshold. The clusters
#' are combined by creating a new cluster membership variable \code{pcGroup}.
#'
#' @param x A \code{data.table} output from the \code{cluster} function.
#'
#' @param errors A \code{list} output from the \code{calc_error} function. The
#'   first element of the list contains the standard deviation and median of the
#'   mass measurement error for each data set. The second element is the
#'   standard deviation of the mass measurement error across all data sets. The
#'   third element is the standard deviation of the retention time in seconds
#'   across all data sets.
#'
#' @param n_mme_sd The number of standard deviations used to create an envelope
#'   around a cluster's centroid in mass space. The standard deviation is in
#'   ppm. This threshold will be used to determine if two clusters will be
#'   combined.
#'
#' @param n_Da The number of Daltons used to create an envelope around a
#'   cluster's centroid in mass space. Any cluster whose centroid falls within
#'   this envelope will be included in the pool of clusters that could be
#'   combined. This value is used to account for isotopic error and is separate
#'   from \code{n_mme_sd}.
#'
#' @param n_rt_sd The number of standard deviations used to create an envelope
#'   around a cluster's centroid in retention time space. Any cluster whose
#'   centroid falls within this envelope will be included in the pool of
#'   clusters that could be combined.
#'
#' @return A \code{data.table} with the updated cluster assignment for each
#'   gene/cluster combination.

  # Naming key/explanation:
  #
  # ridley - The data frame containing each cluster centroid. This data frame
  # will be looped through until all clusters have been grouped. It is possible
  # that a cluster will not be grouped with any others.
  #
  # samus - A data frame that will contain the proteoform/cluster groups. The
  # proteoform/cluster group variable in this data frame will be returned at the
  # end of the function after being joined with the input data frame to ensure
  # it is the proper length.
  #
  # metroid - A temporary single row data frame. This data frame contains the
  # centroid of the current cluster. All remaining centroids in the ridley data
  # frame will be compared to the centroid in metroid. If any centroid in ridley
  # falls within the mas/rt envelope and the ppm threshold it will be grouped
  # with the centroid in metroid.
  #
  # metroid_group - Another temporary data frame that contains the rows of
  # ridley that fall within the mass/rt envelope and below the ppm threshold.
  # These rows represent clusters that can be combined with the current cluster
  # (in metroid).

  # Determine the size of each cluster. This will be used to combine clusters
  # (smaller clusters are added to larger clusters). Calculate the mass/rt
  # centroid.
