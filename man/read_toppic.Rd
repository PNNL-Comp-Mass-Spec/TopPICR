\title{Read in TopPIC files}
\usage{
read_toppic(file_path, file_name, faims = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A character string specifying the path to the folder with
the TopPIC output files.}

\item{file_name}{A character vector of file names containing the files output
from TopPIC. The output from these files will be combined into one
\code{data.table}. Currently this function can read in data from either
ms2_toppic_prsm.tsv files or ms1.feature files. When reading in data all
files must be the same type (e.g., ms2_toppic_prsm.tsv).}

\item{faims}{Logical. If true the data contain multiple FAIMS compensation
voltages (CVs).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \code{\link[readr]{read_tsv}}.}
}
\value{
A data.table where all the data from the input files are combined
row wise.
}
\description{
A wrapper function to the \code{read.delim} function that is specific to the
files output by TopPIC. Metadata is always included at the beginning of the
TopPIC file and a header is always provided. This function removes all lines
containing metadata and reads in the remaining lines of the file starting
with the header. Variables needed for the remainder of the TopPICR workflow
are added and variables not used by TopPICR are removed.
